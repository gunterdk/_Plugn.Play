# Plug & Play
(W.I.P)

A fast-paced, top-down 2D pixel game where you control a robot that must stay connected to power sockets to survive. Manage your power cord, unplug to attack, and overload sockets to progress—all while keeping your battery from running out.

## Features
- **Dynamic Cord Mechanics** – Drag, stretch, and unplug your power cord strategically.
- **Risk/Reward Combat** – Unplugging grants power but drains battery.
- **Puzzle Elements** – Overload sockets to disable enemy respawns and unlock new areas.

## Visual Style
- **16-bit Pixel Art** – Simple and readable design.
- **Color-Coded Objects**:
  - Player (Robot): Blue
  - Power Cord: Glowing yellow
  - Sockets: Red (interactable)
  - Enemies: Black with red outlines
- **Industrial Sci-Fi Theme** – Exposed wires, metal floors, and a rogue AI-controlled factory.

## How to Play
- **Move:** WASD
- **Unplug/Dash Attack:** Spacebar
- **Recharge:** Stay near sockets
- **Overload Sockets:** Stand on them to disable enemy respawns and progress.
